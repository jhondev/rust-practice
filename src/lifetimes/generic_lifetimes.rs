// A generic lifetime is the lifetime of a reference in code,
// where we can't know all of the possible concrete lifetimes of
// the values being referenced at compile time.
// - Concrete lifetimes of referenced values are unknown
// - Generic lifetimes can exist in the definitions of
//   functions, methods, structs, enums, and traits.
